Course AI projects, a lot of fun! 

>The hrd file provides three input.txt files with uncompleted input file and the input3.txt is the classical 横刀立马.
>hrd.py provides the solver with A* and dfs algorithm. 
>run by "python3 hrd.py  <input file>  <DFS output file>  <A* output file>" (if "python3" does not work, try "py")
>ie "python3 hrd.py puzzle5.txt puzzle5sol_dfs.txt puzzle5sol_astar.txt"
>hrd.validate is a script to compare the generated output file with given solution files. There's no solution file for input3.txt, but the optimal solution for it suppose to be cost of 116.
